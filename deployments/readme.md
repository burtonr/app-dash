# App Dash Deployments
This directory contains samples of various methods that can be used to deploy app dash to your setup

## Kubernetes
Create a [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) with [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#use-case-as-container-environment-variables) and [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)

View the sample files here: [kubernetes](./kubernetes/readme.md)

## Others
The app dash is packaged as a single container for the application. You should be able to easily deploy this to any system that allows running a container. 

However, if you'd like to see any other examples, please submit the request as an issue on this repo: [Create a new issue](https://github.com/burtonr/app-dash/issues/new)
